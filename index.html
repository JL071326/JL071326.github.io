        <h2>About me</h2>  
        <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Chinese as a Second Language at Peking University in China. 
            I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Southern California. My dissertation investigates how syntactic and discourse-level factors interact in reflexive resolution in Mandarin. 
            In my academic research, I work on sentence processing, including (but not limited to) pronoun resolution in Chinese, English, and Korean, by drawing on different online and offline methodologies. 
            I am also interested in the topic of logophoricity in theoretical linguistics and second language research in general. 
            I welcome collaboration on topics related to anaphora and cataphora resolution in L1 and L2. If you are interested in my research, feel free to get in touch with me. 
            When not doing research and teaching, I enjoy going out to nature and frequently go hiking in the outskirts of Beijing and the adjacent cities. After my completing my Ph.D., I have come to realize the importance of mental health and physical health. I try not to feel guilty when taking the entire weekend off from work!</p>
